Dear [Employer's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to come to work for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and decided it would be best for me to see a doctor.

I was diagnosed with a viral infection and was advised to rest and recover for the next few days. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better.

I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return to work. Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Arman Shaikh
